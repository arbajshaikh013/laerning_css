    <p class="t_para">Ahmednagar, founded in 1494 by Ahmad Nizam Shah I, has a rich history marked by its strategic importance, the rise of the Nizam Shahi dynasty, and significant cultural developments.
Founding and Early History
Ahmednagar was established in 1494 by Ahmad Nizam Shah I on the site of a battlefield where he defeated the Bahamani forces. The city was built as a planned settlement, featuring gardens, palaces, and a layout that reflected the architectural conventions of the time. The establishment of Ahmednagar marked the beginning of the Nizam Shahi dynasty, which ruled the region until 1636.</p>
