    <p class="f_font" >Ahmednagar's history centers on its founding by Malik Ahmad Nizam Shah I in 1494 as the capital of the Nizam Shahi dynasty, one of the Deccan Sultanates, rising as a significant political and cultural hub before its conquest by the Mughals in 1636. Key features include its famed impregnable fort, resistance led by Queen Chand Bibi against Mughals, and later rule by Marathas and the British, with the region evolving into a cooperative movement center and now part of Maharashtra.</p>
